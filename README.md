# Big_Data_Cars_Analysis

The Big Data Cars Analysis project leverages Python and Pandas to process and analyze a large dataset of car-related information. The project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and extracting insights from the data to support decision-making and trend identification in the automotive industry.

**Features**

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values using mean imputation (fillna() method).

Data Transformation: Converting data types and standardizing formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and correlations.

Statistical Analysis: Computing key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

Data Visualization: Generating plots to better understand car-related trends.

**Technologies Used**

Python (for data processing and analysis)

Pandas (for data manipulation and cleaning)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and visualization)

**Future Improvements**

Integrating advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.

Implementing interactive dashboards using Power BI or Metabase.

Expanding dataset coverage for better insights.
